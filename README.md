# SIEM Log Analysis — Brute Force & Phishing

This project demonstrates how to detect **brute-force SSH login attempts** and **suspicious phishing emails** using **Splunk**.  
It includes sample log data, custom queries, visualizations, and a lightweight triage playbook.  
The goal is to showcase **SIEM log analysis, threat detection, and investigation skills** for a real-world scenario.

## Quick Run

1. **Upload logs into Splunk**
   - Go to *Add Data → Upload*  
   - Upload both CSVs (`linux_ssh_logins.csv`, `email_gateway.csv`)

2. **Run the saved searches**
   - Brute force detection (SSH)  
   - Phishing detection (suspicious emails)

3. **Visualize the data**
   - Build dashboards:  
     - Top IPs  
     - Timechart of login failures/successes  
     - Suspicious email tables

4. **Review detections**
   - Use the queries provided  
   - Correlate events with DMARC/DKIM, spam score, suspicious attachments, and subject line patterns

## Triage Playbook (Quick Guide)

- **Step 1: Brute Force**
  - Investigate source IPs with multiple failed logins  
  - Check if any attempt succeeded after many failures  
  - Correlate with threat intel feeds

- **Step 2: Phishing**
  - Identify emails failing DMARC/DKIM checks  
  - Flag high spam scores (>7) for manual review  
  - Investigate suspicious subjects (e.g., “URGENT”, “Password”)  
  - Check for dangerous attachments (`.exe`, `.zip`, `.scr`, `.bat`)

- **Step 3: Escalation**
  - Escalate confirmed malicious events to SOC team  
  - Recommend blocking sender domain / quarantining attachments

## Skills Demonstrated
- Splunk SPL & Elastic KQL queries  
- SIEM log ingestion & analysis  
- Detection engineering (brute force, phishing)  
- Dashboard building for SOC visibility  
- Writing triage playbooks for incident response
